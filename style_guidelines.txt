Overall Look and Feel of Moicart
===============================

The website should look simple yet still be interactive and elegant. We want to make a paralax website for a 
seamless user experience. 

Colours
========
For Moicart, we want the colours that we use to reflect the type the type of service that we are providing. 
We chose coulours like green and white to represent nature, energy, growth, harmony, freshness, safety, and savings. 
These are our color swatches:

- #5EFF00
- #FFFFFF
- #8551FF

Iconography
===========
We will focus on using icons that have a 'flat' design, which adheres to the overall look and feel.
When selecting an icon, please select the correct icon for the job and keep the following in mind:

Typography
==========
We will be using Coves Bold from rec/fonts/Coves/Coves Bold.otf.

Links
=====
Links will not be underlined and should change color when a user hovers over it.

Buttons
=======
Buttons will be flat designed using the chosen colors outlined above.
