Overall Look and Feel of Moicart
===============================

- The website should look simple yet still be interactive and elegant. We want to make a paralax website for a 
  seamless user experience. 
- The website will enforce horizontal scrolling to create an engaging and unique 
  experience for the user. Users will be able to flawlessly transverse through the website with button shortcuts
  and a visual navigation bar which indicates which segment of the paralax page they are on. 
- The website's overall design will emphasize the use of interactive elements with important information or objects.

Colours
========
- For Moicart, we want the colours that we use to reflect the type the type of service that we are providing. 
  We chose coulours like green and white to represent nature, energy, growth, harmony, freshness, safety, and savings. 

These are our color swatches:

- #5EFF00
- #FFFFFF
- #8551FF
- #FF005E
- #A100FF
- #005EFF

Iconography
===========
- We will focus on using icons that have a 'flat' design, which adheres to the overall look and feel of a minimalist design.

Typography
==========
- We will be using Coves Bold from rec/fonts/Coves/Coves Bold.otf.

Links
=====
- Links will not be underlined and should change color when a user hovers over it.

Buttons
=======
- Generic buttons will be flat designed using the chosen colors outlined above. 
- Key buttons whuch direct the user to download the application or
  signup to the service will be enhanced to emphesize attention through shifting
  throughout the outlined colour spectrum.
